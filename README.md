# lexical-analyzer

  this is a project assigned to us in class that lasted throughout the whole semester. Essentially we are building the building blocks to an interpreter language like python that we would use to translate code that was given to us through cases by text files. each folder is the steps taken to get to the interpreter which is located in pa3. pa1 contains the beinning where we would build the analyzer of the language via tokens to assign each operation to something and give them a name to know what we would do to them in the future. pa2 contains the parser step of the project which essentially just assured that the program was able to take the text files and make sure that the structure for the text file with the code was valid. Lastly we have pa3 which completes the whole assignment and interprets what the file has and brings in functionality to the whole program to make the interpreter language work.
